The client was looking for help to finish the 3rd phase of the application (he had some issue with the current team that was working on the project).

That task was to complete the development of the Front-end of the application. There were a couple of base features, also styles and stability improvement.

It was a big project and a big challenge, however, we took the project and finished it successfully!

Stack: React.js, Next.js, Redux, Redux-saga, TypeScript.
