I worked as React/TypeScript Front-End developer on Booking Flight & Stopover Web Application Version 2 project for the Etihad Airways for the 8 months in the Front-End Team.
We don't use any online package and framework to building UI, and then We created and customized whole component based on React/Javascript/Html/CSS.
